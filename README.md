The cement industry faces several challenges in ensuring consistent and high-quality cement production. Variability in raw materials, process parameters, and environmental conditions can lead to fluctuations in cement quality. The goal is to create and develop a reliable and accurate Cement quality prediction model into a website, providing manufacturers with the ability to assess the quality of cement based on their inputted data. The application should provide accurate predictions of cement quality parameters, enabling proactive measures to optimize production, reduce waste, and enhance overall operational efficiency. The prediction model should take into account various factors such as the main components of cement, blast furnace, fly ash, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, water, superplasticizer, and age(day) to generate an individual quality assessment for each type of cement. The presence of fraudulent cement dealers and the varying expectations of customers pose significant challenges. This research aims to develop a predictive modeling system that not only assesses cement quality but also incorporates mechanisms to detect and mitigate fraud in the supply chain. Additionally, the model will be designed to factor in customer satisfaction, recognizing the diverse preferences and expectations of end-users. Addressing these multifaceted challenges will contribute to enhancing the overall reliability and trustworthiness of cement products in the construction industry.
